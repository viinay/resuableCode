See https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/16861

This worked for me:
npm cache verify

Then I re-ran:
npm install -g create-react-app

And it installed like as expected: Issue resolved

Some other solutions mentioned are:

npm cache clean --force

OR

Deleting npm and npm-cache folders in Users%username%\AppData\Roaming (windows 7) and running npm install

OR

Update npm by via npm i -g npm

OR

Delete package-lock.json

OR

npm cache verify

OR

npm cache clean

OR

do these steps to fix the problem:

find all outdated packages and update theme:
npm outdated -g
sudo npm i -g outDatedPKG
upgrade npm to lateste version with:
sudo npm i -g npm
delete package-lock.json file.
delete _cacache directory in ~/.npm: npm cache verify
every time i get that error, do steps 2 & 3.
if you still get the error, clear npm's cache:
npm cache clean --force
OR

add proxy to .npmrc in ~ directory:
proxy=http://localhost:8123
https-proxy=http://localhost:8123

try again! slow internet connection and censorship may cause this ugly problem.
OR

npm cache clear --force && npm install --no-shrinkwrap --update-binary

OR

npm config set package-lock false
